title: Kelly Marshall's Critique of Armstrong's "Lost Century" Quotes
---

The following article is an excerpt from Kelly Marshall's *Mystery of the Ages: A Critical Review,* which can be found as a PDF at [Exit Support Network](https://exitsupportnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MOA-critique-by-Kelly-Marshall.pdf). 

It is a long read, but it documents a typical method Armstrong would use to get quotes to seem as if they said something they *really do not*.

PCG Watch is reposting it here as we feel it will make it easier to access rather than having to search through Marshall's complete book to find it.

## Lost History of the Church

HWA wants his readers to believe that early church history is scanty and suspicious," aproduct of a great cover up orchestrated by the devil himself. Nevertheless, the surviving earlychurch documents have been covered extensively in my article True Original Church/FaithOnce Delivered (Proof Herbert Armstrong Lied About the "Lost" Church Century!) Confident ofhis findings, HWA paints a picture of scholars and historians agreeing with his assessment:

<blockquote>
Scholars and church historians recognize that events in the early Christian Churchbetween A.D. 50 and 150 can only be seen in a vague outline—as if obscured by a thickmist. (p. 280)
</blockquote>

In the interest of "proving all things" we will look at the sources that HWA gives in the MOAand see if he is guilty of misquoting, omissions, and misrepresentations, which would certainlynot be the fruits of a man of God. First HWA quotes Edward Gibbon:

<blockquote>
Now we quote from a book of history, <em>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em>, Volume I and chapter 15: "The scanty and suspicious materials of ecclesiastical historyseldom enable us to dispel the dark cloud that hangs over the first age of the Church." Ihave often called it "the lost century" because the history of that Church was lost at thattime. (p. 280)
</blockquote>

Now I will supply the *full quote*. The red text is the sentence quoted in the MOA. The boldlettering is my emphasis, while the historians' footnote commentaries to Gibbon's writings arein brackets:

<blockquote>
Part I. The Progress Of The Christian Religion, And The Sentiments, Manners, Numbers, And Condition Of The Primitive Christians.*
<br><br>
[Footnote *: In spite of my resolution, Lardner led me to look through the famousfifteenth and sixteenth chapters of Gibbon. I could not lay them down without finishingthem. The causes assigned, in the fifteenth chapter, for the diffusion of Christianity, must,no doubt, have contributed to it materially; but I doubt whether he saw them all. Perhapsthose which he enumerates are among the most obvious. They might all be safely adoptedby a Christian writer, with some change in the language and manner. Mackintosh seeLife, i. p. 244. - M.]
<br><br>
But this inquiry, however useful or entertaining, is attended with two peculiar difficulties. <div style="color: red">The scanty and suspicious materials of ecclesiastical history seldom enable us to dispelthe dark cloud that hangs over the first age of the church.</div> The great law of impartiality too often obliges us to reveal the imperfections of the uninspired teachers and believers ofthe gospel; and, to a careless observer, their faults may seem to cast a shade on thefaith which they professed. But the scandal of the pious Christian, and the fallacioustriumph of the Infidel, should cease as soon as they recollect not only by whom, butlikewise to whom, the Divine Revelation was given. The theologian may indulge thepleasing task of describing Religion as she descended from Heaven, arrayed in her nativepurity. A more melancholy duty is imposed on the historian. He must discover theinevitable mixture of error and corruption, which she contracted in a long residence uponearth, among a weak and degenerate race of beings.*
<br><br>
A candid but rational inquiry into the progress and establishment of Christianity may be considered as a very essential part of the history of the Roman Empire.While that great body was invaded by open violence, or undermined by slow decay, apure and humble religion gently insinuated itself into the minds of men, grew up insilence and obscurity, derived new vigor from opposition, and finally erected thetriumphant banner of the Cross on the ruins of the Capitol. Nor was the influence ofChristianity confined to the period or to the limits of the Roman Empire. After arevolution of thirteen or fourteen centuries, that religion is still professed by thenations of Europe, the most distinguished portion of human kind in arts and learning aswell as in arms. By the industry and zeal of the Europeans, it has been widely diffusedto the most distant shores of Asia and Africa; and by the means of their colonies hasbeen firmly established from Canada to Chili, in a world unknown to the ancients.
<br><br>
[Footnote *: The art of Gibbon, or at least the unfair impression produced by thesetwo memorable chapters, consists in confounding together, in one undistinguishablemass, the origin and apostolic propagation of the Christian religion with its laterprogress. The main question, the divine origin of the religion, is dexterously eluded(otherwise avoided) or speciously conceded (erroneously accepted); his plan enables himto commence his account, in most parts, below the apostolic times; and it is only by thestrength of the dark coloring with which he has brought out the failings and thefollies of succeeding ages, that a shadow of doubt and suspicion is thrown back onthe primitive period of Christianity. Divest this whole passage of the latent (underlyingor hidden) sarcasm betrayed by the subsequent one of the whole disquisition, and it mightcommence a Christian history, written in the most Christian spirit of candor. - M.] (Edward Gibbon, <em>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em>, Random House, N.Y., ch.15, p. 382).
</blockquote>

Read in complete context, we begin to understand the full meaning of what was really said.This book concerns the Roman Empire—its rise to world power, and its fall— and howChristianity triumphed in the face of the Empire's decay and final collapse. When oneunderstands how fervently the powerful Roman officials tried to stamp out this "new religion,"it truly is a miracle that it not only survived, but prospered, outlasting the Empire itself. So inspite of what seemed to be "silent and obscure" beginnings for this humble religion, it hasmanaged to triumph beyond the confines of the Empire, and become established throughoutthe world. The great Empire that once was responsible for persecuting this new religion, byquirk of fate, was now responsible for the spread of this same religion. The historianaccurately discerns the error of Gibbon's comments concerning the unfair impression he givesconcerning the "shadow of doubt and suspicion" of primitive Christianity. He correctly pointsout Gibbon's error in blending the early origins of Christianity (which exist as accurate records)with its later progression (possibly referring to the thirty years after the destruction ofJerusalem in 70 A.D.) in order to reach his conclusion.

HWA undoubtedly read these very same records, but extracted one sentence to prove that hisclaims of lost church history were true. HWA misrepresented the writings of Gibbon's by notdivulging the full context of Gibbon's discussion. His failure to point out the authentic historicalchurch documents in existence is nothing short of deception.

Now let's examine the second quote given by HWA:

<blockquote>
The noted English scholar Samuel G. Green in A Handbook of Church History wrote:"The  thirty years  which followed  the close of the  New  Testament Canon  and thedestruction of Jerusalem are in truth the most obscure in the history of the Church. Whenwe emerge in the second century we are, to a great extent, in a changed world." (p. 280)
</blockquote>

HWA continually challenged his followers to "prove all things." How can one prove these thingsif HWA refuses to give out precise information so one can follow this specific dictate? Noticethat   the   source   that  HWA   has   quoted   above  contains  no  publisher,  no   dates,  no   pagesnumbers, no footnotes, nor an Appendix. For one who claims to have the "truth," he isn't veryforthcoming   with  particulars.  One  reason,   of  course,  is   to   make   it   difficult  to  verify  hisinformation. But another reason for this is to screen out those who were willing to put theirtotal trust in his claims—these are the ones HWA is looking for. How many of us thought, "I'llhave to look that up and see if what he says is true," only to never get around to doing it?Others of us started to look up these claims, only to be frustrated by the inability to locate theinformation. So we gave up and said, "He seems to know what he's talking about, so I'll trusthe's telling the truth." Still others, who questioned the minister about these sources, weretold, "These books are no longer in publication. They were written in the early 1900s, backbefore evolution and other false teachings permeated society. These older books containedvaluable information before Satan caused worldly scholars to edit most of these truths out."(Members can easily recall HWA's penchant toward the 1911 edition of the  *Encyclopedia Britannica* as a prime example of this reasoning).

Today, fortunately, the Internet can be very helpful with procuring information and after muchsearching I was able to locate a copy of this book. The full quote is provided below. The redlettering is the portion quoted in the MOA:

<blockquote>
<em>Obscurity of the History, A.D. 70-100</em>. - <div style="color: red">The thirty years which followed the close of theNew Testament Canon and the destruction of Jerusalem are in truth the most obscure in the history of the Church. When we emerge in the second century we are, to a great extent,   in   a   changed   world.</div>  Apostolic   authority   lives   no   longer   in   the   Christiancommunity; apostolic miracles have passed; the Church has fairly begun her pilgrimage through "the waste of Time." (<em>A Handbook of Church History, From the Apostolic Era to the Dawn of the Reformation</em>, Samuel G. Green, D.D., The Lutterwoth Press, London:1937, p. 22).
</blockquote>

Notice that the sentence quoted by HWA states, "When we emerge in the second century weare,   to   a   great   extent,   in   a   changed   world."   The   sentence   says   "changed  world"—not"changed religion." In fact, if there had been specific quotes about this, we can guarantee thatHWA would have quoted it in his usual dramatic, over-emphasized style. Remember—whatHWA doesn't say is just as important—if not more so—than what he does say. This author alsodoes not validate HWA's "lost century" dogma. Green states that church history was obscure(but not completely lost) for only <strong>30 years</strong>—from 70 A.D to 100 A.D. Remember, HWA stated(bolding mine):

<blockquote>
<strong>Scholars and church historians recognize that events</strong> in the early Christian Church between A.D. 50 and 150 can only be seen in a vague outline—as if obscured by a thick mist. (p. 280)
<br><br>
I have often called it "the lost century" <strong>because the history of that Church was lost atthat time.</strong> (p. 280)
</blockquote>

This is why HWA omitted the first part of the paragraph "*Obscurity of the History, A.D. 70-100*." He didn't want to publish any dates that would be contrary to his theory and makereaders suspicious. Clearly, Dr. Green does not support the notion of a "Lost Century" and HWA knew this and tried to hide this fact.

Now let's look further into the context of Green's book and see if it supports this "lost century/false church emerges in Rome" theory. Predictably, HWA does not quote the previousparagraph of this book.

<blockquote>
<em>Extent of the Church at the close of the Century.</em> On the whole, the later part of the firstcentury instructively shows that the kingdom of God cometh not with observation. At itsclose, however, Christian Churches were already planted in the chief cities of Syria andof Asia Minor; possibly also in Mesopotamia; in Greece, in Macedonia, and Dalmatia; inRome, and possibly in Northern Africa and Western Europe. The remnant of the Churchof Jerusalem, returning from Pella, lingered amid the ruins of the Holy City (now calledAelia Capitolina), under, it is said, the Presidency of Symeon; the Gentile mother-churchin Antioch flourished under the care of Ignatius; Polycarp had commenced his lengthenedand illustrious ministry in Smyrna; and in Rome the chief pastor Clement, often thought,but on insufficient grounds, to have been the "fellow-labourer" of the Apostle Paul (Phil.4:3). (<em>A Handbook of Church History, From the Apostolic Era to the Dawn of the Reformation</em>, Samuel G. Green, D.D., The Lutterwoth Press, London: 1937, p. 22).
</blockquote>

If church history had been lost, then these historians seem to have had no trouble finding it.In fact, by the end of the first century, the church was well established and thriving, and manyof their writings were preserved. HWA did not quote Samuel G. Green's previous paragraph,because he knew it would flush his bogus "lost century" theory down the toilet.

If HWA taught that "theologians and scholars are deceived" and "don't understand" even thesimplest "truths," why is he quoting these very same "*deceived*" scholars and theologians? Ifthey are truly instruments of the devil, why would he quote them at all? HWA bashes themthroughout this chapter of MOA, but whenever he can find something they say that remotely agrees with him, he quotes them as *sources of proof*!

HWA quotes another historian without giving any precise information:

<blockquote>
In  <em>Lectures on Ecclesiastical History</em>, William Fitzgerald wrote: "Over this period oftransition, which immediately succeeds upon the era properly called apostolic, greatobscurity hangs...." (p. 280)
</blockquote>

Again, we must question why HWA did not supply the reader with information to look up this particular quote. Wouldn't he *want* his readers to be able to verify what he says, if it is indeed,true? Now let's look at the full context of what William Fitzgerald was discussing. First, Bishop Fitzgerald describes the primacy of the Jerusalem church:

<blockquote>
While that city stood, the Church there formed a sort of local centre to the early churches,with far higher claims than Rome could reasonably pretend to. It was, in reality – whatthe Church of Rome so falsely and so absurdly calls herself – the mother of all churches,to which all the lines of spiritual descent in other places converged, and in which theymet. It was the place in which our Lord's own ministry had closed, and in which thepresence of the Comforter had been first manifested, and it was the golden link ofconnection between the old and the new dispensations.
</blockquote>

Bishop Fitzgerald observes the importance of the dissolution of the Jerusalem Church:

<blockquote>
With such advantages as these, it is not wonderful that the Church of Jerusalem shouldhave exercised great influences over the whole circle of the Christian community, andthere certainly was no small danger that, especially after the guiding hand of the inspiredApostles was withdrawn from this central wheel as it were of the ecclesiastical machine,its movements might have been highly prejudicial to all that depended on it. There was manifest danger that the national peculiarities of the Church of Jerusalem might beimpressed upon Christianity itself, and a character thus given to the religion which wouldrender it unsuitable to discharge its important function of blending freely with theinstitutions of all nations and all climes and all ages, in which the true secret of its realstrength and permanence lie.
<br><br>
The almost synchronous events of the removal of the Apostles, and the disruption of theJewish polity, seem thus to have been so arranged by Providence that the latter to someextent compensated for the former. And just at the time when the Judaising tendency of the Church of Jerusalem was likely to do most mischief, the Roman arms drove it fromits metropolis and violently broke up the associations of local dignity to which it owed its influence.
</blockquote>

Without the influence of the original apostles, it would have been far too easy for the central church to fall prey to Judaizing or Galatianism. God used the Roman army to scatter theJerusalem Church to prevent this from happening. Bishop Fitzgerald continues:

<blockquote>
By these events, however, as I said, the churches were for a certain space deprived of themeans of combined action. That central tie of common government, or at least a commonpoint of contact, which had been supplied by the Apostles and elders at Jerusalem, wastaken from them, and nothing of the same sort substituted in its room. Thus each separateChristian community was thrown upon its own resources for the conservation of theapostolic faith and the working out of such institutions of church order as might suits itsown case.
</blockquote>

After this scattering, there was no central church government, or point of contact. Eachbelieving community had to work out its own church order. This, in turn, had quite remarkableresults, as we will later see. Next comes the quote that HWA provided in the MOA: [HWA'squote in red]

<blockquote>
<div style="color: red">Over   this   period   of   transition,   which   immediately   succeeds   upon   the   era   we   callapostolic, great obscurity hangs.</div> I shall endeavor presently to assign some reasons forthat obscurity.
</blockquote>

Now *why* would HWA ignore the sentence after his quote? Did he not think that readers woulddesire to hear Bishop Fitzgerald's explanations? Or is it because he wanted them to believethat church history was lost, even if it means misrepresenting the words of a Bishop? HWAclaimed that church history was lost during this period, "as if obscured by a thick mist." Heclaimed that the curtain began to lift around A.D. 150, but now this "original church" hadbecome a totally different church, but still called itself Christian. Continuing from the quoteabove, let's see if Bishop Fitzgerald agrees with this assessment:

<blockquote>
But what I wish to remark at present is that the fact of such obscurity, combined withwith all the antecedent probabilities of the case, and the little that we do know of the history of that interval, seems to make it certain that no great piece of combined action on the part of the whole Church in its federative capacity can have taken place during it.Such an event could not have occurred without impressing some permanent record of it soccurrence upon the annals of the time. And therefore, <strong>when in the middle of the next century the mist begins to clear off, and shows us the spectacle of the churchesdiffused over the whole surface of the Roman Empire, and beyond it, acknowledging everywhere the same essential articles of faith – tracing their religion to the samepersons,   founding   their   faith   upon   the   same   miraculous   facts,   appealing unanimously to the same documents as the well-attested records of their founders' teaching – and practicing the same external rites as delivered down to them by those founders,</strong> this is very strong and convincing evidence that such an uniform system of belief and practice could not have originated in that short, dark interval. There was in that interval no common authority which could have fixed these things for all the churches diffused over so wide a surface...It is surely incredible that any such universal empire as this should, like Jonah's gourd, spring up in a night and vanish with the day. But if therewas none, then it is plain that the unanimity which meets our view in the secondcentury was the result of the independent testimony of the several churches, each preserving for itself, by diligent inquiry and examination, the records of the apostolic teaching. It is the uncoerced testimony of a multitude of independent separate witnesses to the same truth.  (<em>Lectures on Ecclesiastical History</em>, William Fitzgerald, D.D., Vol. 1, pp. 132-134; London, 1885.27)
</blockquote>

According to Bishop Fitzgerald, when the mist began to clear around A.D. 150, churches were established all over the Roman Empire. Even more miraculous was the fact that even without acentral   authority,   they   were   all   in   agreement—not   only   with   each   other—*but   with   the founders of the original church!* This is nothing short of remarkable. The original teachingshad been preserved in spite of the fact that there was no central authority  overseeing thisoperation.   Clearly,   we   see   HWA   omitting   information  that   did   not   agree   with   his   claims concerning the transformation of the early church into the false church. This would explainwhy he did not provide adequate references. He did not want his readers to find what he wastrying to hide.

The next proof that HWA gives states: (bolding mine)

<blockquote>
In <em>The Course of Christian History</em> William J. McGlothlin wrote: "But Christianity itselfhad been in [the] process of transformation as it progressed and  at the close of theperiod was in many respects quite different from the apostolic Christianity." (p. 280)
</blockquote>

Let us once again, carefully observe what is said. Since HWA lifted this sentence out ofcontext, we cannot know what exact "period" that the author was referring to. We can clearlysee that the author was speaking of a definite historical time period that had come to close.Knowing what specific time period the author was referring to would make a major differencein the context of this sentence. Past experience with HWA's dishonesty in quoting and/oromitting historical records would appropriately cast suspicion toward his direction. 

HWA repeatedly refuses to supply precise information so one can look up this quote. Howdifficult could this have been? He doesn't even provide a footnote! I was able to locate a copyof Dr. McGlothlin's book. Below is the full quote in context, plus the exact source from where itwas derived. The red type is quoted in the MOA, while the bold type is my emphasis:

<blockquote>
Second Period – 100 to 323 A.D.
<br><br>
No. 18: BEGINNINGS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
<br><br>
<strong>We have now followed the rapid spread of Christianity over the empire during thesecond and third centuries, and have seen it finally conquer the emperor and achieve its freedom</strong>. <div style="color: red">But Christianity itself had been in process of transformation as it progressed and at the close of the period was in many respects quite different from the apostolic Christianity</div> of <strong>A.D. 100</strong>. At every step it had been changing and these changeswere making the Catholic church.28 (<em>The Course of Christian History</em>, page 27; W. J.McGlothlin, Ph.D., D.D., The MacMillan Company, 1919).
</blockquote>

HWA plainly tampered with this sentence, omitting the date of A.D. 100. Why? Because on page 293 of the MOA, he claimed: (bolding mine)

<blockquote>
There ensued a hundred years in which <em>all history</em> of the New Testament Church <em>was destroyed</em>.
</blockquote>

HWA claims that these scholars recognize that events in the early Christian church between A.D.50 and A.D. 150 can only be seen in a vague outline, as if obscured by a thick mist. In thisbook, William J. McGlothlin makes no such claim. Instead, Dr. McGlothlin confidently states that apostolic Christianity existed up until A.D. 100, reducing the time of the "lost century" by 50 years! HWA obviously couldn't have that piece of evidence floating around, so he altered thesentence to make it agree with his theory. How can anyone trust a man that would knowinglyalter a pertinent piece of information in order to make his theories sound correct?

Also contained in this book are thorough outlines of eight historical periods of the Church tothe present day, and lengthy details of each period. At this point in our review, we are onlyinterested in the first two periods. The First Period covers the time from 1 A.D. to 100 A.D.The Second Period extends from 100 A.D. to 323 A.D. This should adequately cover the "lost century." Dr. McGlothlin makes some interesting observations during these time periods. Under the First Period, Dr. McGlothlin writes:

<blockquote>
"What is  <strong>certain  is that  by the end of the first century Christianity was firmly established in most if not all the great cities of the empire</strong>, that it had spread into many of   the   smaller   towns   and   even   into   country   districts.   In   some   sections   Christians constituted a large and influential element in society." (<em>The Course of Christian History</em>,page 17, Section 10, Saul's Conversion and Work).
</blockquote>

This author certainly doesn't seem to agree with HWA's assessment of a lost century. Primitive(apostolic) Christianity, by the end of the century, was firmly established throughout theempire and flourishing, which easily corroborates with Samuel Green's earlier assessment.

On page 247, HWA faulted traditional churches for having a "democratic" form of government.Dr. McGlothlin also informs us what type of church government the early church established:[bolding mine]

<blockquote>
"Organization  is  necessary   to   success   in   any   great   task  and   so   we   very   early   find   theChristians organized into bodies which they called ecclesiae, a word which is translated intoEnglish by the word churches. The basis of organization was <strong>fraternal equality</strong>. "Call no manyour   father,   for   one   is   your   Master   and   all   ye   are   brethren."  <strong>This is fundamental democracy, and these early churches were undoubtedly democracies in principle as far as possible in practice</strong>. Paul appointed elders for the churches, but it must have been inconsultation with the brethren in whose hands the ultimate authority rested. (<em>The Course of Christian History</em>, page 17, Section 11, The Churches).
</blockquote>

HWA's top-down government (which he claims to be theocratic, but in reality is a dictatorship) that he had supposedly "restored" from the early church is a false claim. We also see that theword *ecclesiae* (ekklesia) simply means *churches*, and contains no "hidden meaning" such as "called out ones."

The final quote HWA gives as proof that a century of church history was lost:

<blockquote>
In <em>History of the Christian Church</em>, Philip Schaff wrote: "The remaining thirty years ofthe first century are involved in mysterious darkness, illuminated only by the writings ofJohn. This is a period of church history about which we know the least and would like toknow the most." (pp. 280-281)
</blockquote>

How difficult would it have been for HWA to give the exact source of this information? Onewould think that he would be enthusiastic for his readers to "prove all things" and would havemade it easier for the reader to locate these quotes. Instead, he has intentionally made thisan arduous task so the reader would become discouraged and simply take his word at his claims. Notice carefully that Schaff states that the  *remaining 30 years*  of the first century were considered obscure (70-100 A.D.), which corroborates with Samuel Green's statements.Schaff's statement clearly does not support a lost century, but only three decades, and those decades weren't *completely lost*. John was still living and writing during this time.

Below we have supplied Philip Schaff's full quote in context. The red type is the quote found inthe MOA: [Bold type mine, comments in brackets mine]

<blockquote>
Sources of Information.

The author of Acts records the heroic march of Christianity from the capital of Judaism to the  capital  of heathenism with  the  same  artless   simplicity and  serene  faith  as   the Evangelists tell the story of Jesus; well knowing that it needs no embellishment, no apology, no subjective reflections, and that it will surely triumph by its inherent spiritual power.

The Acts and the Pauline Epistles accompany us with reliable information down to the year 63. [HWA's "50 A.D.- 150 A.D." date is clearly debunked here]. Peter and Paul are lost out of sight in the lurid fires of the Neronian persecution which seemed toconsume Christianity itself. We know nothing certain of that satanic spectacle from authentic sources beyond the information of heathen historians. A few years afterwards followed   the   destruction   of   Jerusalem,   which   must   have   made   an   overpowering impression and broken the last ties which bound Jewish Christianity to the old theocracy. The event is indeed brought before us in the prophecy of Christ as recorded in the Gospels,   but   for   the   terrible   fulfillment   we   are   dependent   on   the   account   of   anunbelieving Jew, which, as the testimony of an enemy, is all the more impressive.

<div style="color: red">The remaining thirty years of the first century are involved in mysterious darkness, illuminated only by the writings of John. This is a period of church history about which we know least and would like to know most.</div>  This period is the favorite field for ecclesiastical fables and critical conjectures. How thankfully would the historian hail the discovery of any new authentic documents between the martyrdom of Peter and Paul and the death of John, and again between the death of John and the age of Justin Martyr   and   Irenaeus.   (Philip   Schaff,   <em>History  of   the   Christian   Church</em>,   First  PeriodApostolic Christianity A.D. 1-100, Volume I, Chapter III. THE APOSTOLIC AGE.)
</blockquote>

Observe how HWA carefully avoided quoting the sentence immediately following the one displayed in the MOA. Could it be because, as Schaff astutely described, he is guilty ofpropagating  *critical conjectures and  ecclesiastical fables* concerning this time period? Notice that Schaff did not say historical writings were non-existent. He simply states his desire forany new authentic documentation that would shed more light during this 30-year period. This would undoubtedly put to rest the many fables generated by false teachers concerning thistime period. HWA has discovered a fertile field in which to sow his seeds of suspicion, much tothe chagrin of church historians.

In conclusion to this Lost Century discussion, we have seen HWA clearly omits information inorder to prove his false theory true. He built up the false belief that church history was lost,and then excerpted comments to make it seem that church historians agreed with him. If HWA were truly a man of God, he would have had nothing to fear *IF* he did indeed have the Truth.Apparently, he knew better and had to stoop to lying through omission of key information thatdidn't substantiate his claims.

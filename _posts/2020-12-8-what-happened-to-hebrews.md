In December 2017-January 2018, Gerald Flurry gave a series of sermons based around Hebrews. After making the dubious claim that Paul wrote the book of Hebrews,<small>This is a conclusion that almost no biblical scholars would say with any confidence, with most coming to the conclusion that there is just not enough evidence to determine its actual author.</small>[^1] he went on to date the book's authorship around 66 AD. 

Flurry then went on to say that: 
<blockquote>
The Judean congregations of God’s Church fled to Pella in A.D. 69, just three years later. The Roman armies had already made two forays into Judah, and it seems obvious that God stopped them because His Work wasn’t finished; it was not yet time for His Church to go to a place of safety. Finally, in A.D. 70, the Romans laid siege to and destroyed Jerusalem, razing the temple and starving the people into submission. - <em>The Book of Hebrews: What Jesus Christ Is Doing Today, p. 2-3</em> 
</blockquote>

This destruction of Jerusalem and the fleeing of a group of Jews to Pella in 69-70 AD was---to Flurry---evidence that there was a similar timeframe available to god's "True Church." As Flurry has done before, the timeframe begins when his god reveals to him that a book has an end-time meaning:<small>The rest of the book of commentary that Flurry has written on Hebrews is full of the most obviously incorrect nonsense the PCG has produced. The obvious reason for Hebrews being written, as every other biblical scholar knows, was to try to convince any Jewish or Gentile readers that an older covenant, while useful in the past, was being superceded by a newer one. This new covenant was one that included Jesus as a mediator between god and man. But Flurry misses this, and seems unable to write a commentary on a book without turning it into a polemic against laodiceans and shoehorning its contents into his own modern-day biblical prophecy.</small>[^2]

<blockquote>It appears that god’s very elect had about three years after this warning before they went to Pella for protection. This could indicate just how close God’s people are to fleeing to a place of safety! (Revelation 12:14). We ought to consider this seriously. While these dates are not precise, one thing is sure: Paul was writing for a time leading into the Second Coming of Jesus Christ! - <em> The Book of Hebrews: What Jesus Christ Is Doing Today, p. 3</em>
</blockquote>

As usual, when the book based on his sermons was eventually produced, Flurry hedged his bets by saying "these dates are no precise." But this was certainly not the attitude members took to the messages when they were first given in late 2017. PCG members were excited that this gave them another reason to believe Jesus would be returning within the next few (or three) years.<small>Interestingly, Flurry's book was finally published in <em>2019</em>, meaning if any unsuspecting reader were to check the dates, they would be able to extend the date from "late-2017 + 3 years," to "2019 + 3 years".</small>[^3] 

There is only one question to ask of PCG members: Are you holding Gerald Flurry accountable for his dates? 

For, as of the publish date of this very article, Gerald Flurry's three years are up---and Jesus is nowhere to be seen.
